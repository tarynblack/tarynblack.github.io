        <p>I am an PhD candidate in the <a href="https://www.ess.washington.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Earth and Space Sciences</a> and the <a href="http://psc.apl.uw.edu/" target="_blank">Polar Science Center</a> at the University of Washington. I use satellite images to measure changes in coastal glacier extent in Greenland and Alaska, to better understand how these glaciers are responding to climate change. See <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> for more information about my current work.</p>

        <p>I am an experienced science communicator and currently serve on the board of the <a href="https://www.engage-science.space/" target="_blank">Engage</a> science communication program at UW. I have shared stories about my research and career path in grade schools, pubs, and more.</p>

        <div id="read-more">

          <p>Prior to pursuing glaciology research, I earned an M.S. in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, during which I studied the behavior of unsteady explosive volcanic eruptions using computational fluid dynamics models. I have a general background in geology and physics, and my previous project experience includes sea ice optics, meteorite petrology, cosmogenic nuclide dating, and paleontology/paleobotany.</p>

          <!-- <p>My current projects include: seasonal and multi-decadal variability of Greenland outlet glaciers, with Ian Joughin of UW-APL-PSC; role of glacier variability for polar bear habitat in SE Greenland, with Kristin Laidre of UW-APL-PSC and Twila Moon of CU-Boulder; cataloguing glacier retreat in Kenai Fjords National Park, with Deb Kurtz of the U.S. National Park Service; and developing TermPicks, a comprehensive database of glacier terminus data, with Ginny Catania and Sophie Goliber of UT-Austin and others.</p> -->
