        <h1>Multidecadal Retreat</h1>
        <p>This was the first project that I worked on during my PhD. I digitized annual terminus positions from 1972 through 2021 for 87 glaciers in northwest and central-west Greenland, based on observations from Landsat 1-8 and Sentinel-1 satellite imagery. Based on these termini, we found that regionally, glacier retreat accelerated around 1996-1997. Looking at individual glaciers, the timing of change is more spread out, but still peaks around 1996-1998. We compared glacier retreat to regional climate data (such as surface mass balance) and found that retreat is more sensitive to increased runoff and ocean temperatures, and less sensitive to offshore sea ice concentration. Because these factors influence a variety of processes, we conclude that several mechanisms (<em>e.g.</em>, ocean-interface melting, m&eacute;lange rigidity, hydrofracture-induced calving, <em>etc.</em>) could contribute to retreat, but none clearly dominate based on our data.</p>
