        <h1>TermPicks</h1>
        <p>TermPicks is a collaborative effort to bring together previous datasets of Greenland glacier terminus positions and identify standards for future work. This project was led by Sophie Goliber and Ginny Catania at UT Austin. The project brings in terminus data from 23 separate sources and cleans and reformats them so they are consistent and can be analyzed together. The resulting TermPicks dataset is more spatially and temporally complete than any of its constituent datasets, allowing for more detailed analysis of Greenland termini. We also worked with machine learning practitioners to ensure that the TermPicks dataset could be used as training data for efforts to automate the digitization of glacier termini in satellite imagery.</p>

        <p>This figure shows the median difference between digitized termini between pairs of authors, in instances where those authors have both digitized a terminus on the same date. Darker squares (larger Hausdorff values) indicate that there is a greater difference the termini that the two authors digitized. This analysis was one of my key contributions to the TermPicks project. <em>From Goliber et al. (2022).</em></p>
