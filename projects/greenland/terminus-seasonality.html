        <p>Glacier terminus positions in Greenland show seasonal variability superimposed on <a href="/projects/greenland/multidecadal-retreat.html" target="_blank">multidecadal retreat trends</a>. For this project I characterized terminus seasonality in Greenland by manually digitizing terminus positions for 219 glaciers located around the coast of Greenland. Terminus positions are derived from Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images and span January 2015 through December 2021, at a monthly frequency for most glaciers, and at 6-12 day frequency for a subset of 20 glaciers in northwest and central-west Greenland. We found that nearly 80% of glaciers in Greenland have significant terminus position seasonality, and that these glaciers are typically in retreat from mid-May through early October. We characterized other aspects of the timing and magnitude of terminus seasonality, such as the rate of retreat events, which peaks in late summer. The seasonality of glacier terminus positions is important because changes at the glacier front influence longer-term glacier dynamics and ultimately affect the mass balance of the ice sheet.</p>
