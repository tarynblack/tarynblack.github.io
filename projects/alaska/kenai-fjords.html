        <h1>Kenai Fjords</h1>
        <p>This project started as a summer internship through the Future Park Leaders of Emerging Change program (now <a href="https://www.esa.org/scientists-in-parks/" target="_blank">Scientists in Parks</a>). I worked with Deb Kurtz of Kenai Fjords National Park to document glacier terminus change in the park based on Landsat 4-8 satellite imagery. I manually digitized spring and autumn ice margins from 1984 through 2021 for the lower trunks of 19 coastal glaciers in the park. Cumulatively, the lower parts of these glaciers lost 42 square kilometers of ice over this time period. We found that most glaciers lost substantial length and area, and only two glaciers advanced during the study period. The glaciers that did not change substantially were predominantly tidewater glaciers. Ice loss in this region affects both terrestrial and marine environments, and the loss of glacier ice and associated ecosystem changes will likely affect local ecotourism.</p>

        <p>This figure shows the seasonal outlines for every glacier in this study. The color scale ranges from purple as the oldest (1984) to red as the youngest (2021). Most of these glaciers retreated and lost area (purple outlines are larger than red outlines). Only two glaciers - Holgate Glacier (d, upper) and Paguna Glacier (j) - grew during the study period. This is likely due to tidewater cyclicity and debris cover, respectively. <em>From Black and Kurtz (2022).</em></p>
