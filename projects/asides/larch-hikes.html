        <h1>Washington Larch Hikes</h1>
        <p>This is a map of hikes in Washington that go through the ranges of subalpine larch (Larix lyallii) and western larch (Larix occidentalis). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larch" target="_blank">Larches</a> are deciduous conifers that turn yellow in the autumn and drop their needles, and hiking to see them during that period is a popular pasttime, oftened called a "larch march". Depending on the completeness and accuracy of the data sources, there may be larch hikes that are missing, or included hikes that don't actually have larches. A great source to double-check for the presence of larches (and whether or not they're currently changing colors) is the <a href="https://www.wta.org/" target="_blank">Washington Trails Association</a>, which provides descriptions and trip reports for most hikes in the state. Always check conditions before you go, and practice <a href="https://lnt.org/why/7-principles/" target="_blank">Leave No Trace</a> on the trail.</p>
