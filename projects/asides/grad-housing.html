        <h1>Graduate Student Housing Characteristics</h1>
        <p>Early during my graduate studies, I recognized the difficulty that graduate students in my program had in finding affordable housing in the greater Seattle area, and the utility of data for informed decision-making. Information about housing quality and costs is also invaluable to prospective students who are deciding whether to come to Seattle. In 2017 I started a housing survey for graduate students in my program, designed to collect data about neighborhoods, rents, and other pertinent details. For the first few years the survey was ad hoc as I refined questions and improved my data analysis; I also worked with UAW 4121, the academic employees union, to develop a version of the survey that was used during contract negotiations. In 2020 I developed a more streamlined, repeatable script to analyze the survey responses, which made it easier to share the analysis with current and prospective students. Some highlights from the analysis are provided below, and additional details about the survey and 2020 and 2022 results are available on <a href="https://github.com/tarynblack/puget_sound_housing" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
