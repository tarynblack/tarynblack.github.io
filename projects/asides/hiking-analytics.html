        <h1>Hiking Analytics</h1>
        <p>I am an avid hiker, and I started tracking my hikes with Strava and a spreadsheet in 2018. One winter weekend, when avalanche danger was high, I decided to stay home and analyze the data I had collected. I was most interested in looking at trends over time. For example, I felt like I had hiked a lot in 2019 but less once the pandemic started, and I wanted to see how the data reflected that. The graphs below illustrate my personal hiking statistics since 2018, such as total annual miles hiked, or the steepness of individual hikes. Seeing these data helps me guide my personal goals for future hikes (I'd really like to get back to my 2019 rates of elevation gain!).</p>

        <p>If you also track your hikes, you can <a href="https://github.com/tarynblack/hiking_analytics" target="_blank">use my code</a> to generate your own hiking statistics graphs.</p>
